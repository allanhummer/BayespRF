# BayespRF Toolbox
The BayespRF Toolbox is a framework for specifying and comparing models of population receptive fields (pRFs). Models are probabilistic and are estimated using the variational Bayes algorithm. The toolbox is built in Matlab and depends upon [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).

Advantages:

- Neural and neuro-vascular / BOLD parameters are estimated on a per-voxel (or region of interest) basis
- Models for any stimulus dimensionality and with any number of parameters can be estimated
- The uncertainty (variance) of parameters is estimated as well as the covariance among parameters
- Models expressing competing hypotheses can be compared based on their evidence (using the free energy approximation).

Disadvantages:

- Model estimation is computationally expensive (> 100 seconds per voxel per CPU core)

*The toolbox is very new and still in development. So please enjoy using it, but treat results with caution. The corresponding paper is out in [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00644) and is undergoing peer review.*

## Installing
1. Download the BayespRF toolbox. You can clone this repository or [download the latest release .zip file](https://github.com/pzeidman/BayespRF/releases).
2. Copy the 'toolbox' folder to a location on your computer of your choice.
3. Add the 'toolbox' folder to your Matlab path with subfolders.

## Running the example dataset (retinotopic mapping)
A good way to get started is to try fitting a pRF model using an example dataset. The toolbox includes a folder called **example_3T** which contains the necessary scripts to automatically download and analyse the example dataset. The dataset is a single subject scanned with 3T fMRI, kindly shared online by the [SamSrf](https://figshare.com/articles/SamSrf_toolbox_for_pRF_mapping/1344765) toolbox.

**Part 1: Downloading the data, extracting timeseries**

1. Copy the example_3T folder, included with BayespRF, to a location of your choice on your computer.
2. Navigate to the **example_3T/scripts** folder in Matlab.
3. Open the **Run_first_level** script. Set the data_root_dir variable to the directory where you would like to store the example dataset. Then run the script. The GLM will be estimated and timeseries extracted for each of 10 runs.

**Part 2: Running the pRF analysis**

1. Edit the **example_3T/scripts/Run_pRF_analysis** script. Change the **data_root_dir** variable to match the location containing the example dataset.
2. Run the Run_pRF_analysis script. A pRF model will be specified covering 2422 voxels. A single pRF will then be estimated (index 1) and a window will be displayed with the results. You can stop the code there, or you can continue with estimating all voxels.

A step-by-step walkthrough of the demo can be found below.

## What's in the toolbox

The toolbox provides a set of functions for specifying and analysing pRF models:

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| spm_prf_analyse | Creates and estimates pRF models. |
| spm_prf_bpa_within_subject | Performs Bayeian Parameter Averaging (BPA) at the within-subject level |
| spm_prf_editor | A graphical editor for adjusting priors in pRF models |
| spm_prf_find_voxel | Gets the index of a voxel within a pRF based on its mm coordinates |
| spm_prf_get_ppd | Gets the prior and posterior predictive density for a pRF model |
| spm_prf_import_label | Imports a Freesurfer label for use with this toolbox |
| spm_prf_import_surface | Imports a Freesurfer surface for use with this toolbox |

The neurovascular signal model (**spm_prf_fx.m**) and the BOLD signal model (**spm_prf_gx.m**) do not generally need to be modified on a study-by-study basis.

## Step by Step

Here's a step by step guide to running a pRF analysis. We'll be working through the steps in the example script supplied with the toolbox (**scripts/Run_first_level.m** and **scripts/Run_pRF_analysis.m**).

**0. Prepare your files**
If you'd like to use the example scripts without modification, you'll need to arrange your data into a folder (data_dir) containing:

- data_dir\ubf*.nii     (Pre-processed fMRI images for one subject)
- data_dir\T1.nii       (Structural MRI)
- data_dir\aps_Bars.mat (Stimuli - a 3D Matlab matrix of size PxPxT for P pixels and T time points)

If your own data has different filenames, that's fine - just go through and update **Run_first_level.m** with the correct filenames.

If you wish to work with cortical surfaces, you'll need to run Freesurfer on your T1.nii image using the recon-all command. This will produce a folder called surf containing the extracted surfaces. Update the surf_dir variable in **Run_first_level.m** (line 8) to tell the script where to find these.

After ensuring that all folder names are correct at the top of Run_first_level.m and Run_pRF_analysis.m, as well as the TR, TE and session numbers, proceed to step 1.

**1. Prepare your inputs**
You need to give BayespRF the timing of your experimental stimuli - in other words, which pixels of the stimuli were illuminated at which time points. An example script is provided **prepare_polar_inputs_samsrf.m** which reads in the 3D stimulus array (data_dir\Aps_bars.mat) and produces a structure in the correct format for BayesPrf. If you have a simple design with successive stimuli of equal length, you can simply update this script with the stimulus duration and stimulus diameter (lines 17-18).

Alternatively, you may wish to customise the stimulus presentation details (i.e. create your own version of prepare_inputs_polar_samsrf.m). This script needs to produce a Matlab structure array with the following fields:

```Matlab
    U(t).dist  = dist;         % Distance
    U(t).angle = angle;        % Angle
    U(t).ons = TR * (t-1);     % Onset (secs)
    U(t).dur = TR;             % Duration (secs)
    U(t).dt  = TR/nmicrotime;  % 1 bin=1/16 second, i.e. 16 bins per second
    U(t).pmax = stim_diameter; % Stimulus diameter
    U(t).pmin = 0.5;           % Minimum PRF size
```

The structure U will have one entry per time point (t) of the stimulus. Time points are indexed from 1. For example, if a bar crosses the display in 20 steps, and this happens 100 times, there will be 2000 entries in U. 

The U structure contains fields which describe the stimulus at time t:
- **Dist** and **angle** are vectors of the polar coordinates illuminated at this time step. 
- **Ons** and **dur** specify the onset and duration of this stimulus in seconds. Here we've set this to assume one frame of the stimulus per TR (the time taken to acquire an MRI volume), but this need not be the case.
- **dt** is the length of each microtime bin in seconds (typically nmicrotime=16). Modelling is conducted at a finer timescale than MRI acquisitions. Each stimulus time step will be divided into short 'microtime' bins of length dt seconds.
- **pmax** is the stimulus diameter in degrees of visual angle
- **pmin** is the minimum entertained pRF size in degrees of visual angle

**Note:** The pRF models have been tested with the resolution of the stimuli downsampled to a [41 x 41] grid. We recommend you do the same with your stimuli. This is done for you in the example script.

**2. Extract timeseries**

Run the example script **Run_first_level.m**. This does a few things for you:

1. Specifies and estimates a GLM to identify voxels which respond to visual stimuli
2. Imports the Freesurfer cortical surfaces (created using the Freesurfer recon-all command) into Matlab / NIFTI format.
3. Creates a mask of voxels which meet three criteria:
   - Respond more strongly to visual stimuli than baseline periods
   - Are on the cortical surface
   - Are at the back of the brain (posterior to y=0mm)
4. Extracts timeseries from these voxels using SPM. These are pre-processed automatically (removing the mean and motion confounds, high-pass filtering and pre-whitening).

For an initial check that the scripts have worked, inspect the files **GLM\VOI_lh_prf_mask_mask.nii** and **GLM\VOI_rh_prf_mask_mask.nii**. These are the masks of included voxels from each hemisphere, which will be taken forward for PRF analysis.

**3. Specify and estimate your pRF model for a single voxel**

Run the example script **Run_prf_analysis.m** up to line 75. This specifies the pRF model by calling the **spm_prf_analyse** function in 'specify' mode. It then estimates the evidence (free energy) and parameters of the model for a single voxel. To review the pRF model's results, the script calls the **spm_prf_review** function. In the window which appears, check the estimation looks sensible.

![pRF review window](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2145293/20844452/c519ef06-b8b7-11e6-85c9-cd12d8459077.png)

Let's go through each part of the figure:

**Prior**: This is the response of the pRF model to each (x,y) stimulus coordinate, with the model's parameters fixed at their prior expectations. The model uses polar coordinates, with prior expectations set half way through their allowed range. Thus the prior polar distance is half way from the centre to the periphery, and the polar angle is half way from -pi to pi radians (pointing to the right). For the polar models, this plot is not very informative and can generally be ignored, as the uncertainty about the parameters shifts the peak of the response, as seen in the next plot.

**Prior Predictive Density (PD)** This is the prior response of the pRF model *taking into account uncertainty about the parameters*. This is done by averaging the response of the model to each (x,y) coordinate with 1000 different sets of parameters, sampled from the priors. The non-linear transforms in the model (detailed in the methods section of the paper) cause the prior to be centred on the middle of the stimulus display (the fovea).

**Posterior**: This is the response of the model with parameters estimated from the data. The response is centred on the lower right of the stimulated area.

**Posterior Predictive Density (PD)**: This is the response of the model, with parameters estimated from the data, *taking into account uncertainty about the parameters*. Almost all of the uncertainty visible as speckles in the prior PD have been explained away by the data.

**Parameters**: The prior (grey) and posterior (black) parameters of the model. These are not necassery Gaussian, due to the transforms applied to the parameters (see the paper for details). The dots indicate the median and the vertical bars indicate the inter-quartile range.

**Outputs**: The modelled signal (red) and data (grey).

For simplicity, you may wish to use the Prior PD and Posterior PD to illustrate the model's parameters in a paper, together with the explained variance, in order to confirm that an interesting amount of variance has been explained. Note that the explained variance must not be used to compare models, as it does not take into account the model's complexity.

**4. Run the model estimation for the whole brain**
Having established everything is working, run the next section of the example script (**Run_prf_analysis.m**, lines 76-88). This will estimate all voxels (using parallel processing if available). The whole-brain results will then be displayed.

**5. Perform an ROI analysis**
At this stage, you may wish to manually label regions of interest (e.g. V1) and summarise the pRFs within the region. In the example dataset, labels are provided for all the visual fields. To plot the summed pRF in left V1, run the next section of the script (lines 96-104).

## Developing neuronal response functions

The toolbox is supplied with example response functions for use with retinotopic mapping. However, the approach is generic and you can develop models for any kind of stimuli. 

The Matlab file **response_functions/spm_prf_fcn_template.m** is a good starting point for developing your own neuronal response function. This example simply models neuronal activity z as a scaled version of the input: z(t) = alpha * u(t), where t is time and experimental stimulation u(t) is either on (1) or off (2). You can run this simple demo on data from the visual pRF example, using the script **run_developer_demo_analysis**. 

To create your own function, copy **response_functions/spm_prf_fcn_template.m** and give it a new name. Customise the response function as desired and run it using example code from **run_developer_demo_analysis** .
